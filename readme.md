# 🛡️ Friendly Happiness

A secure, role-based full-stack application focused on authentication, auditability, and DevOps best practices.

This repository will evolve into a complete system with:

- 🔐 A React frontend (see [`frontend/`](./frontend/)) with MSAL authentication and role-based access
- ⚙️ A backend API (coming soon) for secure data operations and token validation
- 🚀 CI/CD pipelines to demonstrate DevOps workflows and deployment automation

📘 For full frontend documentation, see [`frontend/readme.md`](./frontend/readme.md)
