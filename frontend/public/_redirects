# _redirects
# @description Redirects all unmatched routes to index.html for client-side routing in a single-page React app.
#
# @behavior
# - Ensures React Router handles navigation instead of the server returning 404s
# - Required for proper routing on static hosts like Netlify
#
# @auditTag redirects-v1
# @lastReviewed 2025-11-01
#
# @todo
# - Confirm compatibility with hosting provider (e.g. Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
# - Add additional route-specific redirects if needed (e.g. legacy paths)
